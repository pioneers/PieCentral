# More detailed brain dumps:

# Notes on UBJSON
# UBJSON is only available to Lua. Any state that needs to be available to C cannot be sent via UBJSON (easily). Any data from UBJSON can be condidered “untrusted” (not resistant against tampering from within studencode)
# String memoization
# The purpose of string memoization is to reduce the number of bytes that need to be sent repeatedly. For example, suppose there was a string “joy0-analog” that needed to be sent in every joystick packet. This takes up 11 bytes in every telemetry packet that conveys no additional information after the first time. String memoization solves this by having the host send a unique number and the string to the controller once at the beginning. The string will then be replaced by this number, which will usually take only 1 byte.
# The host can memoize strings sent to the controller. The controller can also send back a TYPE_MEMOIZE_STRING back to the host for e.g. telemetry. IDs may overlap between the two.
# TYPE_MEMOIZE_CLEAR clears both directions
# String port
# This port is directly mapped to stdio. No encapsulation
# printf() from robot appears here
# data written to this port should be made available via scanf, etc.
# Code/trace
# Code is always host-->robot
# Trace is always robot-->host
# Code is not run immediately. Running the code is controlled by the config port.
# How to trigger trace is TBD
# Config
# The majority of host “controlling” the robot happens here. This includes field control logic.
# VM state control
# The host can completely stop execution of any studentcode by sending a stop command. This tears down the VM and frees all of the associated state.
# Start will cause a VM to be created. Standard libraries will be loaded but no studentcode will be.
# Load main thread is used to load the studentcode. The studentcode must have been sent earlier using the code port.
# Replacing the studentcode should work. This needs to be worked out on the runtime dide. Loading studentcode when there is already a studentcode should tear down the student-controlled parts of the VM without rebooting the entire VM.
# Patching will be controlled here. Exact behavior TBD.
# Field control logic
# Field control logic is here (rather than e.g. a UBJSON port) so that it is impossible for students to cheat it.
# There are three stop/run states (unfreeze, stop, unpowered) because of corner-cases with e.g. servos. There are extensive notes on this elsewhere.
# Autonomous and teleop are needed by the C code to block access to the joystick (PiER never did this). It will also be exposed to Lua
# Smartdevice logic
# Smartdevices will be enumerated by the firmware at TBD time. The host can request a list of devices using the get list command. This will return a list of smart device UUIDs.
# The firmware will automatically handle bw allocation and most of the details of communicating with devices. The UI needs to handle human-readable descriptors and binding devices to meaningful names.
# The UI can get descriptions of the devices by reading the descriptor information. See smartdevice spec.
# In order to help identify devices that are already mounted on the robot, the UI can command the LED on the smartdevice to blink.
# Joystick
# Joystick packets contain a number of channels that each contain a number of values. Each individual value can be referred to as <channel name>-<value number>
# For the Xbox 360 joystick, there would be 2 channels: button, analog with 11 and 8 values
# Multiple joysticks can be sent in the same packet
# Telemetry
# Telemetry contains channels that can contain 1 or more samples
# Behavior very similar to joysticks
# Telemetry is batched up and sent at intervals
